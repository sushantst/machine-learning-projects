#Machine Learning Projects


This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I have completed. Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a README file describing the project, the data used, and the techniques and models used to solve the problem.

#Projects


Project 1: Predicting diabetes patient using Support Vector Machine
Project 2: Quality of transmission prediction of RoFSO using Machine Learning.

#Dependencies

All projects were implemented using Python 3 and require the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

To run any of the projects, simply navigate to the project directory and run the main Python script. For example, to run Project 1:

bash
Copy code
cd project1
python main.py

In this repository you will find dataset along with code to execute it
